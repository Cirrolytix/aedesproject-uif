In 2022, the situation escalated further with approximately 221,000 recorded cases, marking an 182% increase compared to the same period in the previous year [Statista Research Department (2019)]. As of July 15, 2023, the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) has reported a total of 80,318 dengue fever cases, with 14 of the 17 regions in the country experiencing an increase in cases over the past month [\"Philippines dengue tally\" (2023)].</p>"},{"location":"#global-dengue-situation","title":"Global Dengue Situation","text":"<p>In 2023, the global dengue situation is alarming.

One of the primary breeding grounds for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the vector for dengue, is stagnant water bodies. Traditional methods of identifying these hotspots often involve labor-intensive field surveys, which are not scalable and may lack temporal relevance. Remote sensing technologies offer a more efficient, scalable, and timely approach to identifying these critical areas (Wood et al., 2017). This paper outlines a comprehensive methodology for detecting stagnant water bodies as potential dengue hotspots using a threshold-based method applied on satellite images.</p>"},{"location":"dengue_hotspot_detection/#data-sources","title":"Data Sources","text":"<p>The methodology employs NDVI for vegetation detection and NDWI for water body identification, both of which are widely recognized in the remote sensing community for their reliability.  Both are calculated from spectral data of Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images.</p> <p>The use of remote sensing indices like the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has gained prominence in environmental monitoring, particularly in the detection of surface water and vegetation cover. NDWI is highly effective in identifying water bodies, as it is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of leaves and can differentiate between water bodies and other land cover types [McFeeters (2013)].  This makes NDWI a reliable tool for detecting stagnant water, which is a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes.</p> <p>Moreover, NDVI is traditionally used for vegetation monitoring but has also been employed to distinguish water bodies, especially in complex terrains [Olayemi et al. (2019)]. The combination of NDWI and NDVI can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental conditions conducive to mosquito breeding. For instance, while NDWI can identify the presence of water, NDVI can help in understanding the vegetation around it, which can also be a factor in mosquito breeding [Chua (n.d.), Ligot and Toledo (2021)].</p> <p>Stagnant water bodies are likely to exhibit less variance in spectral characteristics over time compared to flowing water bodies.

Within each category, water bodies are detected using the values of the pixels of NDWI images (greater than the 98th percentile).  This acknowledges that high-NDVI areas (dense vegetation) will have different NDWI characteristics than low-NDVI areas (sparse or no vegetation).  </p>"},{"location":"dengue_hotspot_detection/#ndwi-variability-and-stagnant-water-detection","title":"NDWI Variability and Stagnant Water Detection","text":"<p>To distinguish between transient and stagnant water bodies, a stagnancy duration is required to ensure that only water bodies that have been stagnant for a significant period are flagged as potential hotspots.

Specifically, the objective f(x) is defined as:</p> <pre><code>f(x)=Explained Variance \u2212 \u03bb \u00d7 Model Complexity\n</code></pre> <p>Here, \"Explained Variance\" measures how well the model accounts for the variability of the response data, and \"Model Complexity\" is quantified using the number of non-zero coefficients in the sparse PCA loadings. The penalty term, controlled by \u03bb, ensures that the model does not overfit by becoming too complex. This objective function allows for a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and simplicity [Snoek et al. (2012)].</p> <p>Bayesian optimization offers several advantages over traditional hyperparameter tuning methods like random and grid search, making it particularly well-suited for high-dimensional and complex models. First, it is computationally more efficient than grid search, which exhaustively explores all possible combinations of hyperparameters [Brochu et al. (2010)]. Second, it aims for global optimization of the objective function, ensuring a more accurate and reliable model compared to the random search, which may miss the optimal set of hyperparameters [Snoek et.al (2012)]. Lastly, Bayesian optimization employs a probabilistic model to predict the objective function's value for different hyperparameters, allowing for more informed decisions about which hyperparameters to test next. This reduces the number of iterations needed to find the optimal set, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the model tuning process (Shahriari et al., 2016).</p> <p>By employing Bayesian optimization, this study ensures a more efficient and effective hyperparameter tuning process, which is crucial for handling the high-dimensionality and complexity inherent in dengue risk assessment models.</p>"},{"location":"multidimensional_risk_scoring/#recursive-feature-elimination-rfe","title":"Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)","text":"<p>For models where the number of principal components is one, the raw variables are fed into the linear regression instead and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is performed for feature selection.
