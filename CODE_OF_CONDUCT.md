# CODE OF Conduct

## 1. Our Vision & Mission
AEDES aims to achieve a sustainable future for humanity by advancing innovations in risk management. We strive to improve risk identification and mitigation through 4IR technologies such as big data, AI, robotics, and IoT. Through big data, we enhance root cause analysis, design, planning, and monitoring to achieve positive outcomes and minimize harms to humanity. Our mission is to empower the public sector and non-profit organizations with multimodal, multidimensional dashboards that inform sustainable risk interventions towards quantifiable impacts on society.
