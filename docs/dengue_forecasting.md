# Forecasting Dengue Cases

The increasing incidence of dengue fever across various geographical regions necessitates the development of robust forecasting models to aid in public health planning and intervention. Accurate and timely forecasts can significantly contribute to the effective allocation of resources and implementation of preventive measures. In this context, AEDES aims to provide a comprehensive forecasting pipeline for predicting dengue cases. Utilizing a multi-faceted approach that incorporates advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, the pipeline is designed to optimize the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts. Specifically, the pipeline is built upon the Scalecast Python package [[Keith (2021)]](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast), a versatile time series forecasting tool that includes automated model selection, model optimization, pipelines, visualization, and reporting. This methodology section elucidates the rationale behind the choice of data sources, preprocessing steps, and machine learning models.

## Exogenous Variables
The use of meteorological data like temperature, humidity, and precipitation is based on their proven correlation with the breeding patterns of Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors of dengue [Van Hau et al. (2022), Li and Dong (2022), Ligue and Ligue (2022), de Almeida et al. (2022),  Chen et al. (2022), Methiyothin and Ahn (2022), Ceballos-Arroyo et al. (2020), Jain et al. (2019), Ruangudomsakul et al. (2018), Link et al. (2018)]. Google Trends data provides insights into public awareness and concern about dengue, which has been shown to correlate with actual case numbers [Methiyothin et al. (2022), Puengpreeda et al. (2020), Rangarajan et al. (2019), Yeh (2019), Tang and Subramanian (2019), Anggraeni and Aristiani (2016), Gluskin et al. (2014)].

## Data Preprocessing

### Outlier Detection and Correction
The initial phase of the pipeline involves data preprocessing, a critical step that significantly influences the quality of the subsequent modeling. Outliers can introduce noise and lead to misleading forecasts [Fu et al. (2023), Shiyuan et al. (2021), Ranjan et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2019), Sankaran et al. (2019), Karthika et al. (2017)].  

Outlier detection and correction using the Lowess Smoother algorithm is employed. This non-parametric method is chosen for its flexibility in capturing complex relationships in the data. The smoother operates with a smooth fraction of 0.25 and one iteration to identify and correct outliers.

### Variable Selection
As there are several exogenous variables (including their lags) being considered initially, there is a need to perform dimension reduction prior to time-series modeling [Ghysels et al. (2016), Fujita et al. (2007)]. The Granger causality test is often employed to identify which variables in a multivariate time series have a predictive relationship with a target variable. Applying Granger causality tests can help in eliminating variables that do not have a causal relationship with the target variable, thereby simplifying the model.  This not only reduces the dimensionality of the model but also improves its interpretability.   


## Model Training and Tuning
### Model Selection
The pipeline incorporates a variety of machine learning models, including MLR, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, Catboost, and GBT.  Linear models like MLR, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet are used for their suitability in capturing linear trends in the data [Marigmen et al. (2022), Patil and Pandya (2021), Olmoguez et al. (2019)]. On the other hand, gradient boosting models like XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost, and GBT are included for their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships [Nascimento et al. (2023), Panda and Mohanty (2023), Methiyothin and Ahn (2022)]. KNN is also employed for its effectiveness in capturing local patterns in the data [Tajmouati et al. (2021)].

The models' performances are evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics on both in-sample and out-of-sample data.

Hyperparameter Tuning
The pipeline includes an automated hyperparameter tuning step, which is essential for optimizing the performance of the machine learning models. This is achieved through cross-validation and dynamic tuning methods.

Data Transformation and Reversion
The pipeline also includes steps for optimal data transformation and reversion, which are crucial for improving model performance. These steps are automated and are part of the [Scalecast package](https://scalecast-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/introduction/Introduction2.html#Fully-Automated-Pipelines), upon which the pipeline is built.
